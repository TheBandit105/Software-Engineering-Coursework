The aim of this project is to create a web - based game, in which the users, being university students, will log in and play a history-based, graphical adventure game. When playing the game, the students will earn points for every correct solution provided to the puzzles given. In order for them to obtain the solutions to these puzzles, the students will have been expected to have read and understood many historical sources (e.g. books, internet etc.). The game will include several sub - systems which will work together in order for the game to run and function correctly as intended by the developers. For example, the game will feature a login system, where the user will create an account for the game. During the gameplay, the score achieved by the user will be recorded to the user’s id and stored in the database entry for the account. Another system is for the puzzle solutions, where the correct answers will be revealed after the user inputs their answers to the questions given in the game. The game will also feature a system where the users can use an inline forum, which will allow them to collaborate on ideas with other users doing the same course. The game will run on the university’s internet network and will use a separate web-server to deliver the pages across the network to any device, of the students’ choice, that is connected to the network.

Before the web game is released to the public, the product needs to undergo several test processes to make sure that the web game works in accordance with the requirement specifications that were outlined by the client. The overall test process will require the game to go through 4 main stages of testing in order for the game to be certified for use. The first stage of the 3 part test process is called the component (or unit) testing. This type of testing will help to identify any underlying issues with the components that make up the architecture of the game. This test is normally carried out by the developers of the game. After this, the individual components of the web game will be integrated together and will go through integration testing. This stage, the combined components are tested as a group to ensure that the integrated system is ready for system testing. The flow of the data from one group of components to the other is checked during this test. The system testing is the third stage of the testing process, where the web game is tested as a fully, integrated system. It is meant to check whether the system meets the requirements as asked for by the client and evaluates the functional and non-functional need for the testing. Finally, the acceptance testing is the last stage of the testing process, in which it is carried out in order to find out if the requirements of the specification are met as per its delivery. This part of the test process is done by the user or customer.

System testing (ST) is simply the testing of the system in its entirety, which means that all the components are combined together in order to check and verify whether the system works as intended by the requirement specifications or not. ST is a type of testing that is known as black box testing, which assesses the running of the given system from a user point of view, given the specification document. This testing is important for many reasons. First of all, system testing allows for completing a full test cycle and secondly, it is carried out in an environment which is almost like the production environment and thus stakeholders can get a good concept of how the user will react to the system. This will lead to the reduction of after-deployment troubleshooting and calls for support on the usage of the system once the product goes live to the public. In this case, once the parts of the game have been tested individually, tested together and assembled, the game needs to go through ST. The game will be checked for different aspects, as clearly stated in the requirements, such as if the game will run smoothly on any device used, if the graphics of the game are nicely created and free of any bugs and if the user controls (e.g. using the WASD keys) work correctly as they should for the game.
